    <h1>You Chose: the left door</h1>
    
    <p>
      Miss Ladybug wanders into the room connecting to the left door, and stops short in the doorway. From the bed in the corner
      of the room, she sees her brother Bumblebee staring right at her. Bumblebee is a two year-old black lab, much bigger than Ladybug. He's gentle with the younger kitten, but they both
      know how to play rough. They both stare at each other until Bumblebee jumps down from the bed and begins to chase Ladybug.
      The young cat sprints out of the room, and <a href="https://3downstairs.glitch.me">down the staircase</a> from the hallway.
