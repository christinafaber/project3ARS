    <h1>You Chose: to hide under the couch</h1>
    
  
    
    <p>
      The little kitten makes a sharp turn from the kitchen into the den. She scurries under the large leather couch and hides. Ladybug soon hears
      Big Bumblebee sniffing around to look for her. She stays frozen until she no longer hears the big breath of the lab.
      <br> Once she's certain the dog is gone, she slowly creeps out from under the couch. She climbs up onto the couch and makes herself comfortable
      surrounded by pillows and the morning sun. Ladybug closes her eyes, and falls to sleep dreaming about the amazing breakfast
      she'll have when she wakes up.
