    <h1>You Chose: to climb to the top of the fridge</h1>
    
    <p>
      Ladybug leaps onto the kitchen counter, barely espcaing the breaths from Bumblebee. She jumps again and rests herself on top of the refrigerator.
      Bumblebee looks up at her from below, confused as to why he can't up there, too. She makes herself comfortable next to the apples and bananas
      by laying down. Bumblebee also lays down where he is. The two animals stare at each other until sleep gets the best of them, and they
      take naps in their special places; separate, but together.
