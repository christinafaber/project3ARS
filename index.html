    <h1>You Chose: to have Ladybug start her day</h1>
    
    <p>
      Ladybug decides that she's had enough sleep, and that she wants to start her day. She jumps down from the big bed and stretches against the scratching post 
      in the middle of the floor. 
      <br>Does Ladybug:
      <br> <a href="https://2cryatdoor.glitch.me">cry at the door to find her brother? </a>or
      <br> <a href="https://2bedroomforfun.glitch.me">begin searching around the bedroom</a> for some fun?
    </p>
