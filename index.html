    <h1>You Chose: the right door</h1>
    
    
    <p>
      Ladybug heads into the door closest to her right. She finds a big bedroom, even bigger than the one she slept in. The bed was made and no
      one was in there. She did, however, find her missing pretzel toy. She grabs it and brings it back to her room so it doesn't get lost again.
      After returning the toy, should Ladybug:
      <br> go into the <a href="https://3leftdoor.glitch.me"> left door</a>, or
      <br> go <a href="https://3downstairs.glitch.me">down the staircase</a>?
